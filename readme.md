# fish-tank

**What is this?**

This is a simple application that uses the processing.js library to create a dynamic interactive fish tank.  The seaweed, bubbles and initial fish size/color/direction are random.  Refresh the page to start over with different everything.  You can add new randomly-generated fish by clicking anywhere inside the fish tank.  bigger things move faster (bigger bubbles rise faster and bigger fish swim faster).  When the bubbles reach the top, the start over at the bottom.  When any fish reaches the left or right side of the tank, it reverses direction.

This was one of the first individual projects I made after completing Khan Academy's introductory javascript course.  Something they don't tell you is that they're really teaching you _processing.js_.

Clicking on the canvas creates a new fish.
